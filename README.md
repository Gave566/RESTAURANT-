# Kusina Pinoy Restaurant 
Kusina Pinoy is a website that shares the delicious and popular food of the Philippines. Our goal is to show people how tasty Filipino dishes are. Some of the well-known meals we feature are Chicken Adobo, Kare-Kare, and Sinigang. These dishes are full of flavor and are part of our culture.

We created this website using HTML and CSS. HTML helped us build the structure of the site, and CSS made it look nice and clean. We used soft colors and a red theme to match the warm and friendly feeling of Filipino food. The layout is also responsive, so it works well on different screen sizes like phones and computers.
